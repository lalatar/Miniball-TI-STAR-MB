This simulation was originally written to simulate one cluster detector of the miniball type in the Heidelberg experiment "Bremsstrahlung im alpha Zerfall".

It was NOT meant to be a simulation of the miniball detector array, though the author (Hans Boie) tried to keep it as open as possible.

It has since been used in simulations of the T-REX setup at REX-ISOLDE (CERN), see https://github.com/VinzenzBildstein/TRexGeant4).

There is no proper documentation and there are hardly any comments in the code.
There are some HowTo-file, which will hopefully be a bit of a help.

I would like to invite everyone, who wants to use the package to contribute to the programming. 

Good luck!
